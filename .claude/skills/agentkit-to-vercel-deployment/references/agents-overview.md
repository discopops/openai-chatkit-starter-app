# Agents overview (AgentKit)

Use this to explain the high-level AgentKit flow and where ChatKit fits.

Key points from the Agents guide:
- AgentKit covers build, deploy, and optimize.
- Build with Agent Builder (visual workflows of agents, tools, logic).
- Deploy with ChatKit (embed workflow into product UI).
- Optimize with evals, trace grading, datasets, and prompt optimizer.
- Advanced ChatKit enables self-hosted UI + custom backend.

When to cite:
- Explaining AgentKit components and the build-deploy-optimize flow.
- Justifying use of ChatKit vs custom backend.
