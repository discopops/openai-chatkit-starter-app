# Thinkia Agent Builder workflow repo notes

Use this only as a minimal, non-authoritative example.

Highlights from README:
- Describes a workflow-based framework and basic structure.
- Provides a generic project layout and example usage.

Caveat:
- Very high-level; treat as placeholder documentation.
