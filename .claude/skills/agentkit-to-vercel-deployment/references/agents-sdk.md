# Agents SDK (OpenAI) quick reference

Use when you want a code-first agent (self-hosted). This maps to chatkit backend.

Key points:
- Agents SDK defines agent behavior, tools, and orchestration.
- In chatkit, integrate custom logic in backend/app/server.py.
- Use env overrides for model and system prompt when possible.
